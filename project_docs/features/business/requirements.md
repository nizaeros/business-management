# Business Management Feature

## Overview
Implementation of a comprehensive business management system that supports multiple locations and hierarchical business relationships. The system provides a modern, AWS/Azure-inspired interface with a compact, professional design optimized for enterprise use.

## Database Schema Extensions

```sql
-- Extend existing businesses table
ALTER TABLE public.businesses
ADD COLUMN parent_business_id uuid REFERENCES public.businesses(id),
ADD COLUMN business_type text CHECK (business_type IN ('global_headquarters', 'regional_headquarters', 'branch', 'franchise')),
ADD COLUMN status text CHECK (status IN ('active', 'inactive', 'suspended')) DEFAULT 'active',
ADD COLUMN has_parent boolean DEFAULT false;

-- Create business locations table
CREATE TABLE public.business_locations (
    id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    business_id uuid REFERENCES public.businesses(id),
    name text NOT NULL,
    address_line1 text NOT NULL,
    address_line2 text,
    city text NOT NULL,
    state text NOT NULL,
    country text NOT NULL,
    postal_code text,
    phone text,
    email text,
    is_primary boolean DEFAULT false,
    coordinates point,
    operating_hours jsonb,
    status text CHECK (status IN ('active', 'inactive', 'temporarily_closed')) DEFAULT 'active',
    created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
    created_by uuid REFERENCES auth.users,
    updated_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
    updated_by uuid REFERENCES auth.users,
    UNIQUE(business_id, is_primary) WHERE is_primary = true
);

-- Create business contacts table
CREATE TABLE public.business_contacts (
    id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    business_id uuid REFERENCES public.businesses(id),
    location_id uuid REFERENCES public.business_locations(id),
    name text NOT NULL,
    designation text,
    phone text,
    email text,
    is_primary boolean DEFAULT false,
    created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
    created_by uuid REFERENCES auth.users,
    updated_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
    updated_by uuid REFERENCES auth.users
);

## Performance Considerations

1. Implement efficient pagination for business listing
2. Optimize image loading for logos
3. Use proper indexing for search fields
4. Cache frequently accessed data
5. Lazy load components and features
6. Implement proper error boundaries

## Security Measures

1. Role-based access control
2. Input validation and sanitization
3. File upload restrictions
4. API rate limiting
5. Audit logging for critical operations

## Success Metrics

1. Average time to create/edit a business
2. Search response time
3. System usage analytics
4. User satisfaction surveys
5. Error rate monitoring
